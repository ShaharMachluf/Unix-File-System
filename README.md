# Unix-File-System
In this project I demonstrated building and using unix file system (writing to a file insted of writing to the disk).  
I built a ufs-like data structure (with super-block, inodes and blocks), implemented ufs methods on file descriptors(open, read, mount, etc) and ufs methods on struct file.  
This repository also contains basic tests for these methods.
